 Chapter 2 - Part 12
 Destructors

 1) click the edit button in the lower right corner.

 2) Copy a few of your user-defined types (the ones with constructors and for()/while() loops from the previous task) here
 3) add destructors
		make the destructors do something like print out the name of the class.

 4) add 2 new UDTs that use only the types you copied above.
 5) Add destructors to these 2 new types that do stuff.
		maybe print out the name of the class being destructed, or call a member function of one of the members.  be creative

 6) Instantiate your 2 UDT's from step 4) in the main() function at the bottom.

 7) After you finish, click the [Compile, Link and Run] button to make sure you don't have any errors.
