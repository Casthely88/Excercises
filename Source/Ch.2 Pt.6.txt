 tasks
 1) write the definition for the Type that leftFoot and rightFoot are instantiations of.
    don't forget to define and implement the member functions 'stepForward()' and 'stepSize()'
    you should be able to deduce the return type of those functions based on their usage in Person::run()
    You'll need to insert the Person struct from the video in this file somewhere.
 
 2) provide implementations for the member functions you declared in your 10 user-defined types from the previous video
    you'll need to add your UDT definitions first so your implementations compile 
    so be sure to paste them in this file before adding your implementations.
 
 3) be sure to write the correct full qualified name for the nested type's member functions.
    This is known as defining them outside of the class definition.
 
 4) After you finish defining each type/function, click the [Compile, Link and Run] button to make sure you don't have any errors.
 
 5) share the url into the #ch2_p06 channel once you've got all 10 implemented

 the days of examples are over!  Good luck!
 
 provide the leftFoot/rightFoot definitions here:
 don't forget to insert the Person struct from the videos here so it's nested correctly.
