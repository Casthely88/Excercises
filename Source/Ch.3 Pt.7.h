/*
 Chapter 3 Part 7:
 Don't #include what you don't use
 
 
 
 0) Click "+ new repl" to make your own repl.
 choose C++11 for the type of repl to make
 Copy the instructions below into your repl.
 
 1) Your task is to refactor your Chapter 3 Part 4 task into separate source and header files.
 Add files via the pane on the left.
 
 2) Put all of your declarations for each class in .h files
 One header file per class ( i.e. Raider.h for a class named "Raider" )
 
 3) Put all of your implementations in .cpp files.
 one cpp file per class ( i.e. Raider.cpp for a class named "Raider" )
 
 4) Put all of your Wrapper classes in a single Wrappers.h file
 if you implemented your wrapper class functions in-class, you'll need to move them to Wrappers.cpp
 
 5) No in-class implementations allowed.
 The only exceptions are the two classes in the juce namespace at the top of that task.
 Watch out for the closing curly brace of the classes in 'namespace juce' when you move them to their own
 
 6) make sure you put those two classes in their own header files.
 Atomic.h and LeakedObjectDetector.h
 
 7) make sure you keep them in the juce namespace
 
 8) replace the main() below with your `main()` from Chapter 3 Part 4.
 The only other thing that should be in this main.cpp is a bunch of #include statements
 
 9) Click the Run button and fix all errors.
 
 Share it to #ch3_p07 when there are no errors.
 
 Remember, your Chapter 3 Part 4 task worked when it was all in one file. so you shouldn't need to edit any of it.
 just split it up into source files and provide the appropriate #include directives.
